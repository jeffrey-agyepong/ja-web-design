# One of the easiest CMS options to connect to a static Astro.js site is **Contentful**. It offers a headless CMS with an API-driven approach, making it straightforward to integrate with Astro. You can use their GraphQL or REST APIs to fetch content at build time or even in real-time with Astro's server-side rendering (SSR) capabilities.

Here are a few steps to integrate Contentful with Astro:

1. **Set up Contentful**: Create an account, define your content model, and add your content.
2. **Install necessary dependencies**: Install the Contentful SDK or a GraphQL client in your Astro project.
