Originally starting as a blogging platform, WordPress now powers 43.4% of all websites worldwide. For several small businesses seeking a new website or a redesign, their default choice is usually WordPress due to its notoriety and large ecosystem. However, after six years of working extensively in the WordPress landscape, I’ve faced several challenges that make it less ideal for small businesses. Instead, I now recommend Astro for developing small business websites. Here are five reasons why:

Security
Due to WordPress’ popularity in the market, it’s often targeted by hackers through vulnerable or malicious plugins, weak passwords, and lack of two-factor authentication. Security is a constant concern for WordPress sites.

Maintenance
WordPress frequently requires updates to ensure it stays secure and functional. Failure to maintain a WordPress site often leads to vulnerabilities and various issues long-term, demanding consistent monitoring and effort.

Site Speed
WordPress sites are notorious for slow performance due to the many features it contains out of the box. Reaching optimal performance requires a significant amount of work.

Scalability
As businesses expand, their websites need the capacity to deal with larger amounts of traffic and complex features. Without substantial optimization, WordPress sites tend to struggle with scalability.

Plugins
Although plugins add extra functionality to WordPress sites, they often present a host of issues. They can slow down sites, conflict with each other, and cause security vulnerabilities.

Why Astro is the Better Choice
Astro is a lightweight JavaScript framework for building fast, content-driven websites. It addresses the challenges of WordPress by offering a streamlined, performance-optimized solution for small business websites. Here’s how Astro shines:

Minimal JavaScript: Astro ships with zero JavaScript by default, ensuring lightning-fast load times and improved performance.
Low Maintenance: With fewer moving parts and dependencies, Astro sites require less maintenance and are easier to keep secure.
Scalability: Astro's architecture makes it easy to scale your website as your business grows, without the need for extensive optimization.
Simplicity: Astro allows for static site generation, which is perfect for the mostly static content needs of small businesses.
Enhanced Security: By minimizing the use of plugins and focusing on core functionalities, Astro reduces the attack surface and enhances security.
