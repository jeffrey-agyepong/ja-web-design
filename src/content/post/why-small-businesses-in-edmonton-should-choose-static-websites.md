In today’s markets, competition is growing fast. For this reason, a fast, secure, and cost-effective website is essential for small businesses. However, many small businesses in Edmonton are losing traffic, conversions, and visibility to slow, outdated websites.

**What is a Static Website?**

Static websites are custom-coded, providing the opportunity to handcraft your website to your businesses' unique needs and goals. In contrast, the websites that many rely on are referred to as dynamic websites, these are sites built using content management systems'(CMS) like WordPress or Wix. While dynamic may be the only option for some, a static website has the power to take your business to the next level. At J.A. Web Design, we recommend static websites as the best solution for businesses looking to improve speed, security, and performance. Here’s why:

&nbsp;

**1\. Speed - The Faster Your Website, the More Attention Your Business will Capture**

Did you know that 47% of visitors expect a website to load in under two seconds? Slow websites drive customers away, costing you sales. Static websites don’t rely on databases or complex processing and are optimized to load instantly. A fast website means better user experience, higher conversions, and improved SEO rankings.

&nbsp;

**2\. Stronger Security to Better Protect Your Assets**

Cyberattacks can be devastating for small businesses. Static websites offer better security because they don’t use databases or server-side scripts, making them less vulnerable to hacking. With a static website, you minimize risks like malware, SQL injections, and data breaches—keeping your business safe.

&nbsp;

**3\. Lower Costs & Hassle-Free Maintenance**

Small businesses often require budget-friendly solutions. A static website can reduce hosting costs because it requires less server power. With fewer moving parts, they don’t need constant performance checks, updates, or troubleshooting, again meaning lower maintenance costs. This leaves your time as a business owner free for what you do best.

&nbsp;

**4\. More Local Customers Reached Through Higher Google Rankings**

In search engines, websites that load quickly and use clean, structured code are ranked above their slower, messy counterparts. This can help your small businesses in Edmonton increase organic traffic and attract potential customers searching for your services. With higher traffic, your website will be better equipped to produce leads.

&nbsp;

**5\. Static Websites are Reliable: No Surprises or Downtime**

Unlike dynamic websites that depend on databases and servers, static websites don’t crash due to traffic spikes or server failures; they remain unaffected by fluctuations. Whether you’re running a seasonal promotion or getting high visitor traffic, your site stays online and accessible 24/7.
