Originally starting as a blogging platform, <a href="https://wordpress.org/" target="_blank">WordPress</a> now powers <a href="https://www.wpzoom.com/blog/wordpress-statistics/" target="_blank">43.4%</a> of all websites worldwide. For several small businesses seeking a new website or a redesign, their default choice is usually WordPress due to it’s notoriety and large ecosystem. However, after six years of working extensively in the WordPress landscape, I’ve faced several challenges that make it less ideal for small business websites. Instead, I now recommend <a href="https://astro.build/" target="_blank">Astro</a> for developing small business websites. Here’s five reasons why:

#### Security 
Due to WordPress’ popularity in the market, it’s often targeted by hackers through vulnerable or malicious plugins, weak passwords, lack of two-factor authentication. Security is a constant concern for WordPress sites.

#### Maintenance
WordPress frequently requires updates to ensure it stays secure and functional. Failure to maintain a WordPress site often leads to vulnerabilities and various issues long-term, demanding consistent monitoring and effort.

#### Page Speed
WordPress sites are notorious for slow performance due to the many features it contains out of the box. Reaching optimal performance requires a significant amount of work.

#### Scalability
As businesses expand, their websites need the capacity to deal with larger amounts of traffic and complex features. Without substantial optimization, WordPress sites tend to struggle with scalability. 

#### Plugin Ecosystem
Although plugins add extra functionality to WordPress sites, they often present a host of issues. They often slow down sites, conflict with each other and cause security vulnerabilities.
