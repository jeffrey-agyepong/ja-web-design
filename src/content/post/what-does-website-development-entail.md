Website development, also known as web development, is the building and maintaining of a website. Think for example, of the construction process, first a blueprint and plan is created, then a builder brings that plan to life. A web developer is much the same, they make the designed ‘blueprint’ of your website into a fully functional website.

**What Needs to Happen Before a Website is Developed?**

The entire website creation process contains many steps and requires a well-rounded skill set.

The first step is content. What needs to go on your website? What visuals are needed? What information will your visitors and potential clients be looking for? How can you communicate effectively to create conversions? How can trust be built? You will answer all of these questions, and more, while working with a copywriter skilled in writing for websites.

&nbsp;

Next comes the website design. A skilled web designer will ask questions such as; What’s your branding and how can it be applied to the website? What colours and fonts will be most effective? What overall feeling or atmosphere does the website require to be most effective? How will the content be structured to capture and maintain the attentions of your visitors? By answering these questions and more a website can go from ‘okay’ to being beautiful and effective.

**Developing the Website**

&nbsp;

Developing can/will include everything from acquiring the domain name to coding the back end of a website. In most cases, to create a fully custom functioning website coding is required.

&nbsp;

A developer will often start by building out the main structure of the website. They will then make the website responsive so that possible customers can comfortably view it on any screen size. Then buttons must be linked up, and the backend coded to the needs of the business. The developer will ensure the navigation functions properly and that the website is easy to navigate. Before launching your website, it will be looked over multiple times and tested for functionality and missing links. If a CMS (content management system) is needed, your developer will look after setting this up for the website.

&nbsp;

A website must be hosted, someone familiar can help you find a reliable host for your website and link the domain and code file to the host to be posted on the web. The security of a website is always of utmost importance so if needed, a developer can help you acquire an SSL certificate to assure your visitors and google of your security. They can also help later with SEO (search engine optimization) and overall maintenance and updates needed for the website.
