If your business is very small and still evolving, maybe ‘doing it yourself’ is the right decision. However, if you want your business to flourish and grow, that requires a quality website. One that will reach the right audience and convert them effectively. Here are a few reasons it may be in your best interest to invest in a quality custom website.

## **Wading Through this Huge Industry Takes Time and Effort**

The web design and development industry is always changing and in a constant state of growth. There are dozens of options and ways to achieve your desired outcome.

With our help you’ll be able to find the right solutions for your business in a timely manner, while also being able to maintain your focus on what you do best, running your business.

## **Template Based Websites are Limited in What They Can Accomplish**

If you were to build your own website, you would not have the time, nor would it be beneficial, for you to educate yourself in the art of custom websites. That leaves you with one option, building a template based website using services like Wix or SquareSpace.

If you’re looking for a quick way to throw information on the web, well, this might be the right option. On the other hand, if you’re looking to take the next step and help your business grow, you’re going to need a website that’s actively working for you, one that communicates your brand identity and values. Templates are limited, every website made looks the same. They can’t cater to your company's unique needs and goals, or utilize the full power of SEO.

## **Quality Requires Knowledge**

It takes time and effort to learn a trade. Web design and development is no different. Good design and content writing requires a deep knowledge of how people interact with the web. Every word of a website must be carefully considered and the structure crafted to capture a visitor's attention and keep it long enough to prompt action. If the creator of a website fails to use principles such as these, visitors will be leaving the website before they’ve even scrolled to the next section.

A design alone is not functional, thus to bring a quality website to life requires an experienced developer. Glitches, poor security, poor SEO, and long loading times will drive away viewers. With professional custom development your website will experience none of these failings.

**Custom Content and Design Helps Your Business Stand Out**

Your business is unique. This uniqueness plays a large role in individuals choosing your service over that of your competitors. A custom website will provide your business the best chance at communicating this to your visitors on the web.

Custom design is also a powerful tool with which to capture a viewer's interest. Imagine a website that showcases your brand identity and values. A website that is cohesive, each page and section flowing naturally. A website like no other, unique to your company. With a website as described, your company can stand out as different among your competitors, whether that's in the Edmonton or Alberta area, or around the world.
