I was contacted by Darcy Hodge mid 2023, having previously worked with him during his time at the International Hockey Academy(now Calgary Hockey Academy). The goal was to create a WordPress website that would info perspective candidates and parents about the new hockey academy based in Valencia, California and serve as a means for parents to sign up their kids.

With the season immanent at the time. I was given the timeframe of a week to get the site up and running. This led me to choose Elementor as the main tool to build the website due to it's simplicity.
