Originally starting as a blogging platform, <a href="https://wordpress.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">WordPress</a> now powers <a href="https://www.wpzoom.com/blog/wordpress-statistics/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">43.4%</a> of all websites worldwide. For several small businesses seeking a new website or a redesign, their default choice is usually WordPress due to it’s notoriety and large ecosystem. However, after six years of working extensively in the WordPress landscape, I’ve faced several challenges that make it less ideal for small business websites. Instead, I now recommend <a href="https://astro.build/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Astro</a> for developing small business websites. Here are five reasons why:

#### Security

Due to WordPress’ popularity in the market, it’s often targeted by hackers through vulnerable or malicious plugins, weak passwords, and lack of two-factor authentication. Security is a constant concern for WordPress sites.

#### Maintenance

WordPress frequently requires updates to ensure it stays secure and functional. Failure to maintain a WordPress site often leads to vulnerabilities and various issues long-term, demanding consistent monitoring and effort.

#### Page Speed

WordPress sites are notorious for slow performance due to the many features it contains out of the box. Reaching optimal performance requires a significant amount of work.

#### Scalability

As businesses expand, their websites need the capacity to deal with larger amounts of traffic and complex features. Without substantial optimization, WordPress sites tend to struggle with scalability.

#### Plugin Ecosystem

Although plugins add extra functionality to WordPress sites, they often present a host of issues. They often slow down sites, conflict with each other and cause security vulnerabilities.

### Why Astro is a better choice

Astro is a lightweight JavaScript framework for building fast, content-driven websites. It addresses the drawbacks of WordPress by delivering a streamlined, performance-optimized solution for small business websites. Here's some ways that Astro outshines WordPress:

#### Low Maintenance

Astro’s simpler architecture reduces the necessity of ongoing maintenance and frequent updates.

#### Enhanced Security

Astro generates static files, significantly minimizing the risk of cyber attack because it removes the dynamic layer often targeted by hackers.

#### Scalability

Designed with expansion in mind, Astro websites can handle significant growth without performance being compromised.

#### Performance

Astro uses a technique called partial hydration that guarantees that only necessary JavaScript is loaded on the site resulting in insanely-quick load times.

Astro is the ideal solution for small businesses aiming for performance, security, and simplicity, if you are looking to create a new website or redesign your existing one.
