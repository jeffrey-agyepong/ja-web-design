     title: ' How do we approach designing a website?',
     description:
       "When approaching website design, we begin with thorough research and planning, followed by gathering inspiration from design sources. Next, we create a wireframe to establish the site's structure, and then focus on user experience (UX) design and intuitive navigation. Once the wireframe is finalized, we move on to visually designing the website, incorporating branding elements. After design approval, we code the website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, ensuring responsiveness and compatibility. Testing and iteration are crucial before launching, followed by ongoing maintenance and support. This systematic approach ensures a visually appealing, functional, and user-friendly website.",
   },
   {
     title: 'Are our websites mobile-friendly and responsive?',
     description:
       'Absolutely! Ensuring that websites we design are mobile-friendly and responsive is a top priority for us. We understand the importance of providing an optimal user experience across various devices, screen sizes, and orientations. By implementing responsive design techniques and leveraging mobile-friendly practices, we ensure that your website adapts seamlessly to different platforms, providing a consistent and engaging experience for all users.',
   },
   {
     title: 'How long does it take to design a website?',
     description:
       'The time required to design a website varies depending on the type and complexity of the site. A simple landing page can typically be designed within a few days, while a more intricate e-commerce site may take several weeks to complete. The duration of the design process is influenced by factors such as the scope of the project, the availability of resources, and the level of customization needed. ',
   },
   {
     title: ' What platforms or tools do we use?',
     description:
       'We primarily utilize a range of platforms and tools to design and develop websites. These include Astro.js, Vue.js, Sanity.io, Vite, PHP, Figma, Netlify, Cloudflare, and WordPress. HTML and CSS serve as the foundation for structuring and styling web pages, while JavaScript adds interactivity and dynamic features. ',
   },
   {
     title: 'How often should a website be updated?',
     description:
       "To keep a website fresh and relevant, it is recommended to have periodic updates. The frequency of updates can vary depending on the specific needs and goals of the website. Factors such as the industry, target audience, content type, and technological advancements play a role in determining the update schedule. Some websites may require frequent updates, such as news or e-commerce sites, while others may need less frequent updates. Regularly assessing and evaluating the website's performance, content, and design can help determine the appropriate update intervals to ensure the website remains engaging, functional, and aligned with your business objectives. ",
   },
   {
     title: 'Can we help with maintenance/updates after launch?',
     description:
       "Absolutely! We provide comprehensive ongoing maintenance services to ensure that websites remain up-to-date, secure, and optimized. After the website is launched, we offer support and assistance with regular updates, such as content updates, software updates, security patches, and bug fixes. We can also help implement new features, functionalities, or design enhancements as your business evolves. Whether it's maintaining compatibility with the latest web standards, addressing security vulnerabilities, or optimizing performance, we are committed to ensuring your website continues to operate smoothly and effectively even after the initial launch.",
