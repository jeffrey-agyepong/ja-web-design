Website design and development are two steps in the website creation process. After the content of a website is decided, the next step is design. Think of this step as the architect that supplies the blueprint, while development is the construction company whose job it is to create the real world, working version, of the blueprint.

In this way, a web designer will create a prototype of the website for the developer to follow as they create the working version.

**What is Website Design?**

Design is an in depth process. A quality designer will not only create visual communication of a brand's identity and values, but will also take the time to work with the company to create a strategy that the website will accomplish.

What is strategy? It is deciding who a company's target audience is and specifically designing a website for this demographic. This is done by answering questions such as:

* What is the company's target audience?
* What do they care about?
* What ideas, emotions, and/or feelings do they resonate with?
* Why have they visited the website?
* What are they looking for?
* How can we build trust?

A designer will take these answers, and many more, to create the appropriate navigational structure, graphics, and visual design of the website. Check out <a href="https://jawebdesign.ca/services" title="Our Services" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><u>Our Services</u></a> to learn more.

**What is Web Development?**

Once the design has been completed the prototype is handed over to the developer. They will then take it and create the functional version through coding and the use of various platforms. Quality development requires attention to detail, such as making sure the website is responsive and that it loads quickly to ensure you donâ€™t lose viewers due to impatience, these are a couple of our top priorities. A developer will often look after acquiring a domain name for their client, hosting of the website, upkeep, and assuring fast loading times.
