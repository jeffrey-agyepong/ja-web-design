The use of Search Engine Optimization is how a website can be helped to rank on Google. We will employ expert SEO strategies tailored to your company's unique needs to get your website ranking on the right searches.

First off, what is SEO? Simply put it is creating content and activity on a website for Google to identify as relevant to people's searches. Google is looking to provide searchers with the most relevant content and information to their questions or queries. Search Engine Optimization is adapting your website’s content to fill Google’s requirements.

Beyond content there are many different avenues which an SEO expert will utilize. There is ‘On-Page’ SEO, which as mentioned already, includes the content on a website, but there is also ‘Off-Page’ SEO. Learn a little about both below.

**On-page SEO**

On-page SEO is the strategy you take on your website itself. Even on a web page there is much we can do to help your website rank well. First off, we would figure out what types of searches you want your web page feature on. For example, a restaurant could target searches such as ‘Good Restaurants in Edmonton’ or ‘Restaurant that Cater in Edmonton’, depending on what they offer to their patrons. While a construction company or health care agent would target completely different topics.

In this way, a website can answer the questions of their preferred audience so as to be relevant to their searches. We would employ this strategy in depth with your company website. It would also be accompanied by carefully researched keyword use, Metadata and Alt Text. Quality design and development we can provide your website will also help it to reach the high standards of Google, and those of your viewers. Technical knowledge such as using heading tags properly and good loading times make a huge difference in how a search engine will regard a website.

**Off-page SEO**

Off-page SEO is a completely different ball park. It is basically, steps you can take outside your website. There are many different tools that will improve what Google sees of your website. The search engines like to see activity. A ‘dead’ or inactive website loses its credibility.

What does off-page SEO consist of? We use tactics such as active social media accounts, a strong back-link profile, acquiring brand mentions, local SEO, and content marketing. Off-page SEO is very technical in nature and is best achieved with an expert to guide your brand to excelling in the high competition that is the web.

**The benefits of Search Engine Optimization**

Search engines are often unpredictable, and the same approach or strategies will not work for every business. Let us help you discover the best strategy for you.
